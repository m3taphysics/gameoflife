# gameoflife kata

This was a 2 hour Kata we ran at Decentraland for the team! Using the known rules we had to code a solution using TDD.

# rules

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population of cells on a two-dimensional grid. The rules of the game are simple:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Using these rules, you can create complex patterns that evolve over time. The game is usually played on a grid of square cells, but it can be adapted to other shapes and dimensions as well.
